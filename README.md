# Basic Longitudinal Control for an Autonomous Car 
This repository contains part of the code for one of my projects for the course Intelligent Vehicles and Autonomous Driving. Essentially, this project aims to enable the car to understand traffic signals, and intersections and respond to them dynamically, with a focus on minimal jerk equivalent to human behavior.

## Overview
It chooses the Humanlike sensorimotor behaviors
- **Action Priming (generation of affordances)**: based on minimal intervention principle
- **Action Selection**: based on basal ganglia structure
## Behaviours 
- **Intersection - actions**:
  - Stopping at the stop line or earlier
  - Crossing the intersectionwithin a given speed intervaland while leaving a safe timegap with the other vehicle.

- **Traffic-Light - actions**:
  - Stopping at the traffic light or earlier
  - Trespassing the traffic lightwithin a given time intervaland within a given speed interval.
 
## Include Files 
In this repository, I am providing only the main code and the include files I worked on and wrote. This does not encompass the entire project.

If you need access to the full project, please contact me via email.
